                                We have not only kept the crew wages competitive, we also kept the cost down by providing Lump Sum monthly budget, where we take the full responsibility of all crew related matters including, crew wages, victual ling, allotment, accounts, relieve plan etc. thus removing work load from our principal’s office.
